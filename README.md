# Application Study For Cuttana

This repository contains the application study (Graph Analytics and Graph Databases) for Cuttana. The project is containerized and is built on top of Pacaci et al. benchmarking framework in their [SIGMOD'19 paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3300076).

We retain the standards and our changes were minor and only to update the project. Overally we add:

1. Support for HeiStream and Cuttana, which published after this paper. 
2. Update deprecated packages and fix issues in Docker images that couldn't be built (due to lack of versioning in packages and updates in Docker)
3. Add features such as specifying thread counts in graph analytics. 
4. Adding more easier use of scripts for Graph Databases. 
5. Fix minor bugs. 


All of the changes can be seen by comparing the last commit to the commits before ;)

You can read the documentation on original repo but If you have any questions, do not hestitate to contact us.
